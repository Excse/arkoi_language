## Introduction
Arkoi Language is a work-in-progress toy compiler written primarily in C++. It is aimed at developers and enthusiasts who are interested in:
- Understanding compiler internals.
- Experimenting with custom language features and optimizations.
- Building a small custom ecosystem around a toy programming language.

While the project is in its early stages, it is designed to be a learning platform for anyone curious about language and compiler design.

---

## Features
- **Custom Syntax**: A unique and intuitive syntax design for the Arkoi Language.
- **Compiler Development**: Learn how a compiler is structured, from parsing to code generation.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Explore basic optimization strategies for compiled code.
- **Assembly Integration**: Includes low-level Assembly code for understanding machine-level interactions.

---

## Installation
To build and run the Arkoi compiler, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- A C++23 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- CMake 3.29.6 or higher.
- A supported build system (e.g., make, Ninja).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Excse/arkoi_language.git
   cd arkoi_language
   ```
2. Create a build directory and configure the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Run the compiler:
   ```bash
   ./arkoi_language <input_file>
   ```

---

## Usage
Once the Arkoi compiler is built, you can use it to compile Arkoi source files into executable binaries or intermediate representations.

### Example
```bash
./arkoi_language ../example/hello_world/main.ark
```

### Output
The compiler will generate the corresponding executable or intermediate output in the same directory.

â”‚â”€â”€ test/               # Unit tests for specific code parts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ snapshot/       # A suit for snapshot testing (lexer, parser, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ example/            # Some examples to showcase the Arkoi Language
    â”œâ”€â”€ hello_world/    # The main hello world program
    â”œâ”€â”€ test/           # An example that demonstrates every Arkoi feature
    â””â”€â”€ ...             # Some other examples (test for calling convention etc.)
```

## Development Goals
The following goals are planned for the Arkoi Language project:

1. **Core Compiler**: Implement basic lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.
2. **Custom Syntax and Semantics**: Define a unique set of rules and syntax for the Arkoi Language.
3. **Error Handling**: Provide detailed error messages for syntax and semantic issues.
4. **Optimization**: Explore optimization opportunities in the generated code.
5. **Ecosystem**: Build supporting tools and libraries for the Arkoi Language.
